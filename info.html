              <p>I have also made a version of this that works in Excel with VBA
                and can archive shipment information to a second Excel Log sheet. 
                This would make identifying data about a sample (when it shipped, 
                what the airbill number was, etc.) easier. Let me know if you would
                be interested in that. </p>
